    Returns the PSD computed in the frequency range given as f_band. The algorithm used to compute the PSD
    is exactly the same as the one ScorEpochs uses, except when check_nperseg = True.
    ScorEpochs uses the default value of nperseg, the feature extraction might use a changed value.

    INPUT
        cfg: dictionary with the following key-value pairs
             freqRange    - list with the frequency range used to compute the power spectrum by ScorEpochs (see scipy.stats.spearmanr()

             fs           - integer representing sample frequency

             smoothFactor - smoothing factor for the power spectrum (0 by default)
             wOverlap     - integer representing the number of seconds of overlap between two consecutive epochs (0 by
                            default)
        freq_range: list with the frequency range used to compute the PSD for task of pattern recognition
        nCh: integer, total number of channels
        epoch: 3d list of the data divided in equal length epochs of length windowL (epochs X channels X time samples), provided by ScorEpochs
        check_nperseg: boolean, if True used to check whether the default nperseg parameter is usable to compute correctly the Spearman coefficient,
                       if not usable, nperseg will be changed. If False, the default value will be used without checking.

    The array of frequencies returned by sig.welch() depends on the parameter called nperseg, which is the lenght of each segment. Aiming to obtain a sufficient
    number of computed PSD values to be able to calculate the Spearman coefficients, while keeping an observation window lenght (in seconds, cfg['windowL'])
    limited and a restricted frequency band (i.e. the alpha band, [8, 13]), it is necessary to modify the computing of nperseg.
    The function called by sig.welch() to obtain the sample frequencies is fft.rfftfreq(), from the scipy library, but numpy includes an identical
    function that performs the same calculations and its raw code is available, unlike scipy's one.
    In the source code of numpy.fft.rfftfreq() (https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/v1.20.0/numpy/fft/helper.py#L172-L221) can be read:

     Parameters
        ----------
        n : int
           Window length.
       d : scalar, optional
           Sample spacing (inverse of the sampling rate). Defaults to 1.
       Returns
       -------
       f : ndarray
           Array of length ``n//2 + 1`` containing the sample frequencies.

     def rfftfreq(n, d=1.0):
       if not isinstance(n, integer_types):
           raise ValueError("n should be an integer")
       val = 1.0/(n*d)
       N = n//2 + 1
       results = arange(0, N, dtype=int)
       return results * val

     Be cfg['freqRange'] = [low, high], if we want that in this band there were at least 9 sample frequencies to compute the PSD with, the value of "val"
     has to be changed, because it is the distance between a frequency and the following one in the array "f" returned by sig.welch()
     (it can be easily verified that f[i] - f[i - 1] = val). "d" is the reciprocal number of "fs", n = nperseg, so it follows:
     val = 1/(n*d) = fs/nperseg
     number of sample frequencies in cfg['freqRange'] = (high - low) / val
     And:
     (high - low) / val >= 9
     val <= (high - low) / 9
     Which leads to:
     fix = (cfg['freqRange'][1] - cfg['freqRange'][0]) / 9
     val = fs / nperseg -> nperseg = fs/val = 1/(val * d) con d = 1/fs
     So:
     segLen = 1.0/(fix * 1/cfg['fs'])
     This way we can obtain an f array and a pxx from sig.welch() which lenght in the interval defined by cfg['freqRange'] is at least 9.
